<strong>WHERE I’VE BEEN</strong><br>
I was born and raised in Sydney, Australia and have worked for a handful of computer repairers for the best part of a decade. Turns out I love to fix things! However, I wanted to venture out into the world of academia. The University of Newcastle took me under their wing for a few years studying Biomedical Science in a full-time capacity.

<strong>WHAT I’M DOING</strong><br>
I have moved back to Sydney, mid-degree, and have now started a new journey with the University of New South Wales in their Medical Science program part-time. I am lucky to have experienced education through two major universities and look forward to what is ahead. The educators of these institutions provide insight into what my own future may hold.

<strong>WHAT I HOPE TO DO</strong><br>
Throughout my life so far there have been people helping and guiding me through my own life. I want to return the favour and help others the way I have been. For me, science is more than a passion, trial and error is a way of life.
