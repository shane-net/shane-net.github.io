<strong>WHERE I’VE BEEN</strong><br>
I was born and raised in Sydney, Australia and have worked for a couple of computer repairers, diagnosing and repairing for the best part of a decade. Turns out I love to repair and fix things! Having always enjoyed science I tried for an entry into The University of Newcastle. I was accepted into my preferred degree, Biomedical Science. I have since moved back to Sydney and been accepted into the University of New South Wales, Sydney.

<strong>WHAT I’M DOING</strong><br>
I am majoring in Advanced Medical Research and have started my third year of an expected four, running at 30 hours a week. To date, I’ve been lucky enough to have some of the best lecturers from their own respective fields give me insight into what my own future might hold.

<strong>WHAT I HOPE TO DO</strong><br>
Help people.
